  <title>Reduced Row Echelon Form</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The Prepare material, and also the Additional Practice, in this section comes heavily from Greg Hartman's Fundamentals of Matrix Algebra.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have learned about the method of elimination of variables and about row operations on matrices; in this section, we learn
      <em>Gauss-Jordan elimination</em> to put matrices into <em>reduced row echelon form</em>.

        Performing elementary row operations on an augmented matrix resulted in a new linear system whose solution
        was the same as the original linear system.  This brings to mind two good questions:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              What is the goal of using elementary row operations?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              How do we achieve that goal the fastest?
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll answer the first question first.  In <xref ref="sec-row-ops"/>, when we manipulated matrices to find solutions,
        we were in fact putting the matrix into <em>reduced row echelon form</em>.

            A matrix is in <term>reduced row echelon form</term>
            if its entries satisfy all four of the following conditions.

                  The first nonzero entry in each row is a <m>1</m>

        We began this section with two questions,
        <q>Where do we go?</q>
        and
        <q>How do we get there quickly?</q>
        We've just answered the first question:
        most of the time we are going to <em>reduced row echelon form.</em>
        We now address the second question.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many ways to use elementary row operations to transform a matrix into reduced row echelon form, 
        but there is a general technique that is efficient and doesn't waste time on unnecessary steps.
        This technique is called <em>Gauss-Jordan elimination</em>, named in honor of the mathematicians Karl Friedrich Gauss
        and Wilhelm Jordan.
      </p>
      <assemblage xml:id="def_gaussian_elimination">
        <title>Gauss-Jordan Elimination</title>
        <idx><h>Gauss-Jordan elimination</h></idx>
        <p>
          <term>Gauss-Jordan elimination</term>
          is the technique for finding the reduced row echelon form of a matrix using the procedure summarized below:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Create a leading <m>1</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Use this leading <m>1</m> to put zeros underneath it.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Repeat the above steps until all possible rows have leading <m>1</m>'s.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Put zeros above these leading <m>1</m>'s.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
  </assemblage>

    <p>
        This is roughly what we were already doing in previous sections when we used elimination and row operations, but let's see an example.
    </p>

      <example xml:id="ex_gaussian_elimination">
          <title>Gauss-Jordan Elimination Demonstrated</title>
          <p>
            Put the augmented matrix of the following system of linear equations into reduced row echelon form.
            <me>
              \begin{array}{ccccccc} -3x_1\amp -\amp 3x_2\amp +\amp 9x_3\amp =\amp 12\\ 2x_1\amp +\amp 2x_2\amp -\amp 4x_3\amp =\amp -2\\ \amp \amp -2x_2\amp -\amp 4x_3\amp =\amp -8 \end{array}
            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            We start by converting the linear system into an augmented matrix.
            <me>
              \left[\begin{array}{cccc} \fbox{-3}\amp -3\amp 9\amp 12\\ 2\amp 2\amp -4\amp -2\\0\amp -2\amp -4\amp -8 \end{array} \right]
            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            Our first step is to make the first entry in the first row a <m>1</m>.  We do this by multiplying Row 1 by <m>-\frac13</m>. (This row operation is also called <q>scaling.</q>)
          </p>
          <sidebyside widths="20% 50%" margins="30% 0%" valign="middle">

            <p>
                <m>\left[\begin{array}{cccc} \fbox{1}\amp 1\amp -3\amp -4\\ 2\amp 2\amp -4\amp -2\\0\amp -2\amp -4\amp -8

            </p>
          </sidebyside>
          <p>
            Our next step is to put zeros under this <m>1</m>. To create a 
            <m>0</m> for the first entry in the second row, we'll use the <q>multiply and add</q> elementary row operation.

          </sidebyside>
          <p>
            The first entry in the third row is already <m>0</m>, so our first column looks good for reduced
            row echelon form.  We now shift our focus from the leading <m>1</m> down
            and to the right, to the position that is boxed.
            </p>
            <p>
            We want to put a <m>1</m> in this position,
            but <alert>we need to restrict ourselves to using only the second row and any rows below it</alert>, as using the first row 
            would put nonzero entries back into the first column and undo the work we just did.
            Let's first swap Row 2 and Row 3, and then scale the new second row (multiply it by a number) so that there is a <m>1</m> in the desired position.

            We have now created another leading <m>1</m>, this time in the second row.
            Our next desire is to put <m>0</m>'s underneath it,
            but that's already done!
            Therefore we again shift our attention down and to the right
            to the next position in a box.
            We want that to be a <m>1</m>, and so we multiply the row by <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>.

              If the entry in the row and column that we are considering is <m>0</m>,
              swap rows with a row below the current row so that the entry is nonzero.
              If this entry is <m>0</m> and all entries below are <m>0</m>,
              we are done with this column; move to the right and do this step again.

        Many authors call the forward steps <em>Gaussian elimination</em>, which puts a matrix into row echelon form,
        and the forward-and-backward steps together <em>Gauss-Jordan elimination</em>, which puts a matrix into reduced
        row echelon form. We will almost always want to obtain reduced row echelon form and will not make a big deal
         about the distinction between the names Gaussian and Gauss-Jordan.

                        Swapping Row 1 and Row 2 would actually work for this matrix, and we'd end up in the same rref eventually. 
                        But part of the beauty of the Gauss-Jordan procedure is that following the prescribed steps of the algorithm always works, 
                        and swapping two rows won't always work to turn a <m>2</m> into a <m>1</m>.

      <p>
        We were inspired by solving systems of linear equations to put matrices into reduced row echelon form, 
        in order to make the solution easy to see.  Every time we've started with a linear system, there was exactly one solution, 
        and the reduced row echelon form always had one particular form.  However, we've also practiced putting matrices 
        in reduced row echelon form without referring back to their corresponding system of linear equations,
        and we have seen various different ways that rref can look.  Connecting different reduced row echelon forms with
        solutions to the corresponding linear system is the topic for next section.

                A matrix could either be in <em>reduced row echelon form</em> or not.  There are four conditions, concerning the locations of zero and nonzero entries, that
                must all be true for a matrix to be in reduced row echelon form.

              <em>Gauss-Jordan elimination</em> is an algorithm that uses elementary row operations to efficiently transform a matrix into reduced
              row echelon form.

              Matrices in reduced row echelon form are useful for finding the solution to a system of linear equations.
